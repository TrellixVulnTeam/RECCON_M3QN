# Recognizing Emotion Cause in Conversations

This repository contains the dataset and the pytorch implementations of the models from the paper Recognizing Emotion Cause in Conversations.

## Dataset

The original annotated dataset can be found in the json files in the `data\` folder. The dataset with negative examples for the Causal Span Extraction and the Causal Entailment of Emotion tasks can be found in `data\qa\` and `data\classification\` folders respectively.

## Execution

We formulate the Causal Span Extraction task as a question answering task. To train RoBERTa or SpanBERT models for this task on the DailyDialog dataset use the following command:

`python train_qa.py --model [rob|span] --fold [1|2|3] --context`

Then, evlaution can be carried out on DailyDialog or IEMOCAP as follows:

`python eval_qa.py --model [rob|span] --fold [1|2|3] --context --dataset [dailydialog|iemocap]`


The Causal Entailment of Emotion task is formulated as a classification task. To train RoBERTa-Base or RoBERTa-Large models for this task on the DailyDialog dataset use the following command:

`python train_classification.py --model [rob|robl] --fold [1|2|3] --context`

Then, evlaution can be carried out on DailyDialog or IEMOCAP as follows:

`python eval_classification.py --model [rob|robl] --fold [1|2|3] --context --dataset [dailydialog|iemocap]`

Without context models can be trained and evaluated by removing `--context` from the above commands.
